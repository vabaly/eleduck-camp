# Writing - Motivation

*  Why do you apply for the job? 

      I'm interested in working for [COMPANY NAME] because I want to give myself the challenge to improve my work skills in a foreign company.

*  Why do they offer you the job? Please answer following three questions
      - Can you do the job? (technical skills)

            At ByteDance, I was responsible for outputting technical solutions and developing them via TypeScript, React.js, React Native, and Node.js.

      - Are you good fit for the team? (soft skills)

            I successfully collaborate on solutions with our product, Designer, QA, and external teams to offer the best user experience to maximize business value.

      - Why do you choose remote work? How do you cooperate with teammates in different time zones?

            - I think I'm independent and autonomous, and I want to get foreign company experience.
            - I can schedule a period of working time to communicate with them.

      - What do you expect from the (remote) job?

            I hope I can improve my working skills and learn about foreign companies' standard workflow and communication skills.
