# Writing - Ability to Adapt

* Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?

    S: One time, our company needed to complete a large project within a month. In the month, we should output PRD, UI, and code.
    T: I maintained a main module. It contained 6+ mobile pages. I needed to communicate with the product manager and designer all the time. And also had to design the technical solutions and implement them. I was pressed for time as I had a lot of work to do.
    A: I put all the things into a to-do list and sorted them by priority. First, I communicated with other people to solve external dependencies such as PRD, UI, and third-party libs. Second, I developed the libs feature for other people. Finally, I can have a lot of time to implement the independence features.
    R: Out project went live as scheduled. And I was praised by my leader and team members.

* Tell me about a challenge task you got before. How did you manage to complete it?

* Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?
